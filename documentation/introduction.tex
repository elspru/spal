\chapter{Introduction}

This is a human speakable programming language, geared for artificial general
intelligence development.

\section{Problem}
\subsection{Disglossia}

\subsubsection{Computer Languages}
In order to program all levels of a modern computer, you need to know many
different programming languages. Assembly/LLVM/SPIRV at the lowest level, C for
system programming, C++/GTK/QT for graphical interface programming,
Javascript/HTML/CSS/PHP/Perl for web programming, OpenCL/OpenMP/Pthread for parallel programming,
bash/python/ruby/node for scripting, Java/C\#/Lua for portable programming,
ansible/chef/docker/kubernetes for administration, a host of different data
storage formats XML/CSV/JSON/YAML/SQL and different documentation languages
LaTeX/Doxygen/Markdown/TexInfo just to name a few. That doesn't even include
statistics, audio, image and video processing languages.

\subsubsection{Human Languages}

\section{Paradigm}
\subsection{Obsolete Non-Parallel Paradigms}
Object Oriented, non-tail recursion, globals.

It's easy to write bad code in many paradigms.

\section{Inspiration}
I was mentally projecting myself into a robot host body one day and realized
that it would take a superhuman Artificial intelligence to be proficient in all 
of the languages and protocols of a modern computer and their interactions.

And I came to the realization that I wanted to be able to have access to all my
knowledge and abilities with one language.
