\section{Overview}
A human programmer writes a function template, function suggestions and 
either provides a working function or sample input and output data. 

An encoder encodes the function template and function suggestions into the
intermediate representation (IR).  

If the human programmer provides a working function, then the function profiler
takes the function template IR and working function and generates the sample 
input and output data. 

A population generator takes the function suggestions IR and input from
/dev/random to create the population IR.\@

The population compiler converts the population IR into kernel or ``.cl'' files,
one for each.

The population tester loads each population kernel, and streams the sample
inputs through them, checking outputs for correctness, and produces the
population fitness which includes fitness of all individuals. 

The champion selector takes the fitness ratings, and the population IR,
and outputs the champions.

The population mutator and recombiner takes the champions and function
suggestions, then generates a new population IR.\@

An output generator takes the champions and outputs the best ones to a file.
