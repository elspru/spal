// suggest file can be generated based on a single suggest list for instance for
// English, and an English word list.
// the suggest list would start with the Pyash word, and followed by 16bit codes
// indicating the index of the synonyms/homonyms in the word list. 
// the foreign word lists would be organized in the same order as the English
// word list, so it would be the same line number.
